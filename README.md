# tinkle-on-tips
Tinkle-On-Tips is a visual sound-kit application with animations. It is designed to let users create music
through their imagination by using the keyboard of their computers. The sounds are embedded into the 
alphabet keys. So use your imagination and create the tunes you like. Happy tinkling!

This project is deployed on [tinkle-on-tips.online](www.tinkle-on-tips.online)

Note: The screen record feature is currently not working right now. It is only capable to record from the mic.
